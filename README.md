# Atmos

## Introduction

Atmos is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) in a simple and efficient manner. It provides a streamlined workflow for defining, deploying, and managing infrastructure configurations across different environments.

### Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define your infrastructure configurations using a declarative syntax, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Environment Management**: Manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with ease using environment-specific configuration files.
- **Reusable Components**: Encapsulate common infrastructure patterns and configurations into reusable components or modules for easy reuse across projects.
- **Automated Deployment**: Automate the deployment process with built-in support for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes to your infrastructure configurations with version control, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.

### Getting Started

To get started with Atmos, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install Atmos by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://atmos.tools/quick-start/install-atmos).
2. **Initialization**: Initialize a new Atmos project in your preferred directory using the `atmos init` command.
3. **Define Configurations**: Define your infrastructure configurations using Atmos's declarative syntax in configuration files.
4. **Create Stacks**: Create stacks for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to manage environment-specific configurations.
5. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Deploy your infrastructure using the `atmos deploy --stack <stack-name>` command.
